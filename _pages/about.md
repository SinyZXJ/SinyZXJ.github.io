I’m a Master’s student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and a research intern at the A*STAR Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), graduating in Jan 2026. Previously, I was a research intern at MIT SMART. I received my B.Eng. in Automation from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITsz). My current interests span <strong> embodiedAI, physical AI, reinforcement learning.</strong>

Long-term, I aim to strengthen robotic perception and behavioral intelligence with machine learning—pushing toward reliable, deployable robotic systems that meaningfully augment human work.

Outside research, I’m a music producer and mixing engineer. Starting in 2026, I plan more active releases — search “Siny” or “_siny” on RedNote / NetEase Music / Douyin to find my tracks🎵.
