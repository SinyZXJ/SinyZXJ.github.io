I’m a Research Engineer and incoming Ph.D. student at Perceptica Robotics, supervised by Dr. Rajat Talak. Before this, I received my master's degree from NUS ME department supervised by Dr. Guillaume Sartoretti and my bachelor's degree from Harbin Institution of Technology, Shenzhen (HITsz). For internship, I used to work as a research intern at the A*STAR Centre for Frontier AI Research (part-time 2025.1-2025.6) and MIT SMART Research Institute (full-time 2025.6-2025-8). My current interests span <strong> robotics perception, embodied AI, reinforcement learning.</strong>

Long-term, I aim to strengthen robotic perception and behavioral intelligence with machine learning — pushing toward reliable, deployable robotic systems that meaningfully augment human work. I believe technology should first be warm.

Outside research, I’m a music producer and mixing engineer. Starting in 2026, there would be more active releases on my social media platforms — search “Siny” or “_siny” on RedNote / NetEase Music / Douyin to find my tracks and updates🎵.
