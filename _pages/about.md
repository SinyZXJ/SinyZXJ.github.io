I'm currently a master student at National University of Singapore (NUS) and a research intern at Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), estimated to graduate at Jan 2026. I developed research on Multi-agent reinforcement learning at Multi-Agent Robotic Motion (MARMot) Lab under guidance of Prof. Guillaume SARTORETTI. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Automation at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITsz).

In the past year, I have primarily focused on multi-agent informative path planning based on reinforcement learning. As a long-term goal, I am dedicated to enhancing robotic perception and behavioral intelligence through machine learning, with the aim of driving tangible improvements in human labor and achieving highly reliable, deployable robotic technologies.

I'm also a music producer and mixing engineer. Starting in 2026, I plan to promote and release my music more actively. You can find and listen to my work by searching for "Siny" on NetEase Music.
